##Deployment
 
This uses Github pages, all you need to do is push to the remote repository and it automatically it's published to http://choosetheweb.github.com.  Using the CNAME file in the root of the directory, Github will redirect choosetheweb.github.com and www.choosetheweb.org to choosetheweb.org.
