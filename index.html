        <h1>Helping to spread the web</h1>
        <p>We use the web all the time we could be in danger of taking it for granted. We thought we should take a timeout to remind ourselves of the why and how&#39;s of the web. We have listed some of the canonical sources to help us, and hopefully others, appreciate the virtues of and dangers to the web as we know it.</p>

			<h3>Long live the web <small> Tim Berners-Lee</small></h3>
			<p>The 20th anniversary of the web allowed Berners-Lee (or TimBL to some) to reflect on the progress the web has made in it&#39;s 20 years.  Berners-Lee stresses what the web has enabled as well as what the challenges are to the universal principles that are being threatened by current trends.</p>

			  <h3>Cool URIs don&#39;t change <small> Tim Berners-Lee</small></h3>
			  <p>A nice explanation of why URIs often get changed, and why that should be avoided. Take for example our very own <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/3925016665/">psd here with TimBL</a> and a link to an event where the photo was taken. Sadly though, Downing Street seems to have gotten itself a new content management system and that link no longer works.  That isn&#39;t cool.  TimBL here looks at some of the common reasons why URIs change, why they are not good enough reasons and what to consider when designing URIs.</p>

			<h3>One Web<small> Jeremy Keith</small></h3>
			<p>Although covering a lot of the design principles, Keith covers the basics of why those decisions have been made and touches upon a lot of important concepts from not making assumptions about the client behaviours and capabilities.</p>

			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>There are so many books in the computing that so many different aspects of the field, yet when prompted, we found it difficult to think of any canonical references about the principles of the web.  However, there are many great articles and presentations on the subject and we wanted to share our thoughts on what we consider to be important opinions.</p>
			<p>The original thought was that this would be for those newly coming to web development either in or straight out of education, or coming from a different aspect of computing.  We think it could apply to a few more, but this is the audience we are aiming for.</p>
